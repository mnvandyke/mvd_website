For a species to persist on the landscape, it must not only survive the direct effects of precipitation changes but also the indirect effects of altered densities, identities, and competitive strengths of neighbors. Using the annual grassland community at Sedgwick Reserve, I explored how changes in precipitation alter competitive dynamics between species. I used temporary rainout shelters to grow six annual species including two grasses and four forbs, in different competitive backgrounds under an amplified and reduced precipitation treatment. I then quantified the strength of competition between species under both treatments using an annual plant demographic model that accounts for germination, fecundity and neighbor density. While finding little direct responses to the precipitation treatments in their seed production, there were changes in competitive abilities and competitive outcomes between species. These findings indicate that small direct effects can amplify to community wide changes through altered competitive dynamics.
