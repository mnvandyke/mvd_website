As greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, understanding how ecological communities will respond to future climate change is critical. In southern California precipitation volatility is predicted to increase with more extreme dry and wet seasons expected in the future. I try to explore the consequences of changing precipitation regimes on plant coexistence using an annual grassland community at Sedgwick Reserve, UCSB.
